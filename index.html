      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is Greg. I studied finance and psychology at the University of Richmond. I then worked in finance at JPMorgan and Bloomberg from 2015-2019. That was all the time that it took to determine finance was not the right industry for me, so I quit, and am working on becoming a software developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Pottstown, PA, but lived in Richmond for four years and Delaware for a year and a half before moving to Philly.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are hiking and reading/talking about current affairs. I typically spend at least two weeks hiking and camping through national parks each year.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm unsure of my dream job currently, but software development seems like an interesting field until I figure that out.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Philadelphia.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy understanding how and why things work. Becoming a developer allows me to have a much better understanding and control of the processes around us that run on software and govern our daily lives.</p>
